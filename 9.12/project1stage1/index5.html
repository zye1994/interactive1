		    <strong>The New Typography(1923)</strong>

		Laszlo Moholy-Nagy

		<br />
		<strong>Typography is a tool of communication.</strong> 
		<br /><br />
			

		
		It must be communication in its most intense form. <br /><br />
		<strong>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms.</strong> <br /><br />

		Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. Therefore priority: <strong>unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.</strong>
